* Emmet3: for emacs

This is a simple package for ~emacs~ which enable a autocompletion for ~emmet-mode~.  I tested it for corfu and it works.  If you are you an user of ~corfu~ then just use the function ~emmet3-capf~.  In my config it looks like the following

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

  (defun my-enable-emmet3 ()
    "Enable emmet3: autocompletion for Emmet."
    (interactive)
    (add-hook 'completion-at-point-functions #'emmet3-capf 5 'local))

#+END_SRC

If you are user of ~company~, then u should use anything like the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defvar company-enable-emmet3 t
  "Enable emmet3 for all backends.")

(defun company-backend-with-emmet3 (backend)
  (if (or (not company-enable-emmet3) (and (listp backend) (member 'company-capf backend)))
      backend
    (append (if (consp backend) backend (list backend))
            (list :with 'company-capf))))

(defun my-enable-emmet3 ()
  (add-hook 'completion-at-point-functions 'emmet3-capf)
  (setq-local company-backends (mapcar #'company-backend-with-emmet3 company-backends)))

(add-hook 'html-mode-hook 'my-enable-emmet3)
#+END_SRC
